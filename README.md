### Install Using Swift Package Manager
The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a
decentralized dependency manager for Swift.

1. Add the project to your `Package.swift`.

    ```swift
    import PackageDescription

    let package = Package(
        name: "MyAwesomeProject",
        dependencies: [
            .Package(url: "https://github.com/nvzqz/Clockmoji.git",
                     majorVersion: 1)
        ]
    )
    ```

2. Import the Clockmoji module.

    ```swift
    import Clockmoji
    ```

### Install Using CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a centralized dependency manager for
Objective-C and Swift. Go [here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/index.html)
to learn more.

1. Add the project to your [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html).

    ```ruby
    use_frameworks!

    pod 'Clockmoji', '~> 1.0.0'
    ```

    If you want to be on the bleeding edge, replace the last line with:

    ```ruby
    pod 'Clockmoji', :git => 'https://github.com/nvzqz/Clockmoji.git'
    ```

2. Run `pod install` and open the `.xcworkspace` file to launch Xcode.

3. Import the Clockmoji framework.

    ```swift
    import Clockmoji
    ```

### Install Using Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency
manager for Objective-C and Swift.

1. Add the project to your [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile).

    ```
    github "nvzqz/Clockmoji"
    ```

2. Run `carthage update` and follow [the additional steps](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#getting-started)
   in order to add Clockmoji to your project.

3. Import the Clockmoji framework.

    ```swift
    import Clockmoji
    ```

### Install Manually

Simply add the contents of the `Sources` folder into your project.

## Usage

The `ClockFace` enum features twenty-four cases for each clock emoji available.

### Time

A `ClockFace` can be created from a time.

```swift
let tenOClock = ClockFace(time: 10)
let sixThirty = ClockFace(time: 6.5)

/// Rounds down in .5 intervals
let twoSomething = ClockFace(time: 2.4)  // two: ðŸ•‘

/// Works with negatives
let twoOClock = ClockFace(time: -10)  // equal to twoSomething

/// Works with large numbers
let crazyFace = ClockFace(time: 42352345432)  // four: ðŸ•“
```

### Date

`ClockFace` can be initialized from a `Date`.

```swift
let noon: Date = ...
let face = ClockFace(date: noon)  // ðŸ•›
```

A `ClockFace` can also be created from the current date if no date is specified.

```swift
let face = ClockFace()  // ðŸ•¥
```

### Pretty Printing

`ClockFace` has multiple properties that make formatting easy.

Printing a clock face directly will print its raw value.

```swift
ClockFace.tenThirty.name  // "Ten thirty"
ClockFace.seven.nameWithAdditive  // "Seven o'clock"

ClockFace.two.rawValueWithAdditive  // "ðŸ•‘ o'clock"
ClockFace.oneThirty.rawValueWithAdditive  // "ðŸ•œ"
```

### Strideable

`ClockFace` conforms to `Strideable`, allowing it to be used within a countable
range.

```swift
for face in ClockFace.one...ClockFace.three {
    ...
}
```

The `advanced(by:)` method circles through faces in either a positive or negative direction.

```swift
ClockFace.two.advanced(by: 4) == ClockFace.two.advanced(by: 28)
ClockFace.two.advanced(by: 9) == ClockFace.two.advanced(by: -39)
```
